# About <a name="about"></a>
<details><summary>➡️  ｉｍｅｖａｎc ⬅️</summary><blockquote>
I studied Engineering at the University of Manchester and was in industry for about 2 years after that. During the pandemic I realised that I needed a break from it and took some time off in order to find myself and plan for my future. Enrolling on the Northcoders bootcamp was one of the best decisions of my life! It helped me to improve both my coding skills as well as many transferable skills. I am interested in the full-stack development with a passion in the test-driven development and software design methods such as Agile. My next role will be in the web dev (ie JS & React) and I have started working on AWS certifications!
