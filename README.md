  Hey there! 👋 <br/>I’m Evan, a full-stack engineer who loves working with React ⚛️ and Node.js 🟢. I spend my days diving deep into JavaScript and TypeScript 💻, building awesome, user-friendly interfaces 🎨 that are both functional and clean. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors 🌳 with my dogs 🐕, either hiking 🥾, paddleboarding 🏄‍♂️, or training them for scent detection 👃. I’m also passionate about open-source 🌐 and currently working on different projects! Let’s connect and build something great together! 🚀
